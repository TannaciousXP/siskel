# Siskel

Siskel is a simple movie rating app. We'll be using this app to expolore backbone events and how they relate to MVC components. In particular, you will explore the following ideas:

```
- Controllers translate click events into intention (invoking a model function)
- Models effect state changes in other models (by broadcasting events)
- Views update as a result of model changes (by listening for changes)
```
